# HTML Void Elements

Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have closing tags and cannot contain content. They are self-closing and typically represent standalone entities or provide specific functionalities within the structure of a document.

Example Void Elements:
`<br>` - Line Break Element
The `<br>` element creates a line break within text. It is a void element and does not have a closing tag.

`<hr>` - Horizontal Rule Element
The`<hr>` element represents a thematic break or separation within content. Like `<br>` , it is a void element without a closing tag.

Usage:
Void elements are typically used for specific purposes like line breaks or thematic divisions. They do not contain content but instead serve as standalone entities within the document structure.

Best Practices:
Use void elements when a specific standalone functionality, such as line breaks or horizontal rules, is needed.
Ensure proper self-closing syntax (`<br>`,`<hr />`) in HTML5 to maintain compatibility.
Browser Support:
Void elements are universally supported across all modern web browsers. They are essential for creating well-structured and readable HTML documents.
