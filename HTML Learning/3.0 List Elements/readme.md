# HTML List Elements (`<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`)

List elements in HTML provide a structured way to organize and present information. There are two main types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`), and both are composed of list items (`<li`>).

Ordered List (`<ol>`)
The `<ol>` element is used to create ordered lists where each item is numbered.

Attributes:
type: Specifies the type of numbering (1, A, a, I, i).

Unordered List (`<ul>`)
The `<ul>` element is used to create unordered lists where each item is bulleted.

Attributes:
type: Specifies the type of bullet (disc, circle, square).

List Item (`<li>`)
The `<li>`element is used to define individual items within ordered or unordered lists.

Best Practices:
Use `<ol>` for sequences or steps with a specific order, and `<ul>` for items without a specific order.

`<li>`elements must always be placed within `<ol>` or `<ul>`.
