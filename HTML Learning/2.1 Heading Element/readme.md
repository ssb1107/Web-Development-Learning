# HTML Headings Quick Reference

HTML headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of a web page. There are six levels of headings, ranging from `<h1>` (the highest level) to `<h6>` (the lowest level).

`<h1>` Heading 1
Main heading. Use for the primary title of the page.

`<h2>` Heading 2
Subheading. Use for section titles or to indicate a lower level of importance.

`<h3>` Heading 3
Sub-subheading. Provides further subdivision within a section.

`<h4>` Heading 4
Used for even lower-level subdivisions or details.

`<h5>` Heading 5
More specific than `<h4>`. Use as needed for finer granularity.

`<h6>` Heading 6
The lowest level of heading. Use for minor details or footnotes.

Usage Tips:

Maintain a logical hierarchy; don't skip levels.
Use headings to structure content for accessibility.
Style headings with CSS for visual hierarchy.
Keep your HTML headings clear and concise to enhance the readability and organization of your web page.
