# HTML Image Element (`<img>`)

The `<img>` element in HTML is used to embed images into web pages. It allows you to enhance the visual appeal of your content by displaying graphics, photographs, icons, and other visual assets.

Attributes:
src: Specifies the source URL or file path of the image.

alt: Provides alternative text for users with visual impairments or when the image fails to load.

width, height: Set the width and height of the image in pixels.

Best Practices:
Use meaningful and descriptive alt text for accessibility.

Provide width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts as images load.

Optimize images for the web to reduce file size.

Browser Support:
The `<img>` element is universally supported across all modern web browsers, making it a versatile tool for incorporating visuals into your HTML documents.
