# CSS Introduction and Usage

Overview
Welcome to the world of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)! This readme file serves as a guide to understanding CSS and how to link it to your HTML documents. CSS is a powerful styling language that allows you to control the layout and appearance of your web pages.

What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It enables you to style your web pages by specifying how elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or even as speech.

Linking CSS to HTML
There are multiple ways to link CSS to HTML documents. Here are three common methods:

1. Inline CSS
Inline CSS is applied directly within the HTML document, using the style attribute.

2. Internal CSS
Internal CSS is placed within the HTML document's `<head>` section using the `<style>` tag.

3. External CSS
External CSS is stored in a separate file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

By following these methods, you can effectively style your HTML documents and create visually appealing web pages. Experiment with different styles to enhance the aesthetics of your website!
