Flexbox Basics

1.Flex Container and Flex Items
Flexbox involves two main components: the flex container and its flex items.
The container is defined by setting display: flex; or display: inline-flex; on the parent element.
Child elements inside the container become flex items.

2.Main Axis and Cross Axis
Flexbox works along two axes: the main axis and the cross axis.
The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis is perpendicular to it.
Properties like justify-content and align-items control the alignment along these axes.

Flex Container Properties

1.display: flex;
Turns an element into a flex container.
2.flex-direction
Defines the direction of the main axis.
Possible values: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse.
3.justify-content
Aligns items along the main axis.
Values: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.
4. align-items
Aligns items along the cross axis.
Values: flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch.
5. align-self
Allows the default alignment to be overridden for individual flex items.
6. flex-wrap
Controls whether the flex container should wrap its content.
Values: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse.
7. align-content
Aligns flex lines along the cross axis.
Useful when there are multiple lines in the flex container.

Flex Item Properties

1.order
Specifies the order of a flex item.
2. flex-grow
Defines the ability for a flex item to grow.
A higher value takes more space.
3. flex-shrink
Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink.
A higher value shrinks more.
4. flex-basis
Specifies the initial size of a flex item.
Can be set as a fixed value or a percentage.
5. flex
Shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
6. align-self
